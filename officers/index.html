					<img class="prof-img" src="harish.png"></img>
					<p>
						Harish Vemuri is a senior at Buchholz High School. He likes to solve hard math problems in number theory, combinatorics and geometry.
						Some of the best sources of such problems are the HMMT, PuMaC and ARML competitions and without FLSAM he would not have had the great experiences of competing at these events.
						Outside of math, Harish enjoys playing tennis and chess.

					<p>
						Jimmy Qin is a senior at Seminole High School. Besides math, his favorite subjects include physics, poetry, philosophy, and most subjects which begin with "p."
						Unsurprisingly, his favorite area of mathematics is polynomials. (Just kidding! – he isn’t mathematically prejudiced.)
						When not doing math or physics or answering life’s persistent questions, he enjoys reading The New Yorker or catching up on those adorable poem-of-the-day emails.
						He is proud to represent FLSAM in the Central Florida region.

					<img class="prof-img" src="Josh.jpg"></img>
					<p>
						Joshua Kennedy is a senior at Fort Myers High School.
						Math has always been his favorite subject, and he participated in his first math competition as a sixth grader.
						Mathcounts, in particular, sparked an interest in competitive math, and since then, he has competed in various contests, including the AMC series, ARML, and Mu Alpha Theta.
						Combinatorics is his favorite branch of mathematics. As Region 4 Co-Coordinator, he hopes to spread FLSAM around the state and to increase interest in higher level math competitions.
						Besides math, he enjoys running cross country and aimlessly surfing the internet.

					<img class="prof-img" src="Keshav.jpg"></img>
					<p>
						Keshav Shah is currently a senior at King High School.
						He enjoys all branches of mathematics and has been participating in math competitions since elementary school, using his exclusion from the school team in second grade as motivation to continually improve.
						In high school, he regularly competes in Mu Alpha Theta contests and the AMC, and FLSAM has introduced him to new opportunities such as ARML.
						While not doing math or schoolwork, Keshav likes to play basketball, read, root for the New York Giants, solve chess puzzles, and sing (to the annoyance of around him).
						He is excited about being a great Region 4a Coordinator this year.

						Kim Nguyen is a senior at Buchholz, but is occasionally associated with the Kim Nguyen Academy for Independent Studies and Enlightenment.
						Kim is a potgut enthusiast, and her entire life is organized on Google Drive.
						After being introduced to competition math by the mathematical prophet Henrik Beocken of the 2015 Florgia HMMT Team, she has found deep intrigue in all branches of math and doesn't discriminate:
						she knows that Geometry is the socially accepted superior. Kim genuinely appreciates the community that FLSAM brings together, and she deeply values all the friendships that FLSAM has helped her create.
